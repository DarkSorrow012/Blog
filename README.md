1. Is necessary have installed and running a web server like Apache or Nginx, PHP, and a database management like MySQLi in my system to execute locally.
2. Create a database: Create a database to store user information, blog posts, and comments.
3. Design the database schema: I have created a database schema to define the structure of the database, including the tables, relationships, and data types.
4. User registration: Create a user registration form that allows users to enter their username and password. Validate the user input, hash the password using a secure hashing command, and store the user data in the database.
5. User authentication: I made a login form that allows registered users to log in using their username and password. Validate the user input, compare the hashed password with the one stored in the database, and create a session to keep the user logged in.
6. Blog post creation: I made a form that allows registered users to create a new blog post. Validate the user input, store the post data in the database.
7. Blog post editing: It was made with a form that allows users to edit their own blog posts. Validate the user input, update the post data in the database.
